  ## Project 2 - Website Blocker
   ## Languages
   + Python
    
   ### A simple python program that blocks websites between certain hours of the day anytime my computer starts
   You can add as many or as few websites as you want. This way is effective because you don't have to rely on anyone turning it on, it        just is on when it is working hours, and when it's not you have access to all the websites you want. It blocks websites by adding to your machines "host" file found within your C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/Hosts.
   
## Project 3 - Web Scraper Project
  ## Languages
  + Python with Jupyter and Pandad Libraries
  
  ### A simple program that scrapes through an old 21st century website about their different listings
  Once you have parsed through all three pages a .csv file is outputed giving the information about the properties listed.
